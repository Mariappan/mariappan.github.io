## Hi there

I am Mariappan Ramasamy.

After a decade working in IT field, I finally created this blog to help me record my GoogleFu for later reference.

We all know how hard is to start a Blog on the web :rolling_eyes:. And after starting, it is evenstill more difficult to keep the blog running. Let's hope I continue this.

These posts may or may not be useful to you.
Feel free to ping me if you want to share comments/thoughts.
